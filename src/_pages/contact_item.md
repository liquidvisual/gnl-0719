## How to get to our Adelaide Office

Our Adelaide office is located in the heart of the city amongst many of South Australia's courts.
We are open Monday to Friday from 8.30 am to 5.00 pm, excluding public holidays.

### Driving

Driving in Adelaide city is relatively easy. We are located at 69 Franklin Street on the corner of Franklin and Pitt Streets. We are on the ground floor of a multi level car park. There is a number of "pay by the hour" public car parks in the area, notably the one directly above our premises.

There is some limited on street parking but time limits are strict and you will require coins for parking fees.  It should be noted that on street parking in the CBD of Adelaide is heavily monitored by the Adelaide City Council and fines apply.

### By Bus

Victoria Square (about 200 metres walk east along Franklin Street) has a number of bus stops around it on Victoria Square and Grote Street (about 100 metres south of our building).  You should confirm available bus routes with Adelaide Metro.

### By Tram

We are conveniently situated near the Hilton tram stop for the Adelaide/Glenelg tram line. It should be noted that travel on the tram is free between South Terrace and the Entertainment Centre.

### By Train

Our office is an approximately 15 minute walk south along King William Street from the Adelaide Central train station, turning right onto Franklin Street and we are about 200 metres along, on the left hand side.
